paper:
   - "You are using Spigot/CraftBukkit for your server."
   - "For the best experience with BetterEnd, and all your plugins, please use Paper!"
   - "Paper contains many optimizations on top of Spigot's, meaning you'll see a huge performance increase."
   - "Paper is a fork of Spigot as well, meaning all your plugins should still work with Paper."
   - "Find out more at their website: https://papermc.io/"
untested:
   - "You are using a server implementation other than Spigot or Paper!"
   - "BetterEnd has not been tested on this implementation, and minimal support will be given should issues arise when using it."
   - "If you experience issues, test on Paper before reporting them!"
   - "If you would like your implementation to be officially supported, contact dfsek on the BetterEnd Discord server."
